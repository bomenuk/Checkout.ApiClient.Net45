# Checkout.ApiClient.Net45

This Api Client project has been modified to cooperate with drinkshopping Web API project

I added a new folder called: DrinkShopping under ApiServices containing all basic classes needed to get the client talk to drinkshopping API endpoints.

There are also unit tests added under folder: DrinkShoppingService to check if both parties can communication correctly plus to verify drinkshopping work as expected.
